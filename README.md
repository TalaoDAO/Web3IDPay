# Stablecoin Transfers with EUDI Compliant Crypto Wallet

## Introduction

The rapid evolution of **digital assets** and **stablecoins** is transforming the landscape of payments, remittances, and digital commerce. However, the adoption of these technologies faces challenges such as **regulatory compliance**, **privacy protection**, and **cross-border interoperability**.

This repository defines a **reference specification** for **stablecoin transfers** that aligns with **European regulatory frameworks** like **MiCA**, **TFR**, and **AMLD6**, while preserving user privacy through technologies like **EUDI wallets**, **OIDC4VP**, and **SD-JWT**. It introduces a secure and auditable payment architecture where **verifiable identity data** is cryptographically tied to digital asset transfers, ensuring both **compliance** and **user sovereignty**.

For further background and industry insights, see the article:
[The Future of Compliant Crypto in Europe â€“ EUDI Wallets and Stablecoin Transfers](https://medium.com/@thierry.thevenet/the-future-of-compliant-crypto-in-europe-eudi-wallets-and-stablecoin-transfers-9d4c6c799c82).

This repository contains the specification for enabling **stablecoin transfers** (e.g., USDC, DAI, EVM-based stable assets) using an **EUDI Wallet** or equivalent **non-custodial data wallet**.
The specification focuses on combining **OIDC4VP**, **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**, and **digital asset transfers** while ensuring **compliance with EU regulations** (e.g., MiCA, TFR, AMLD6) and **data privacy (GDPR)**.
